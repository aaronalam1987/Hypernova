A space shooter game create in Python using the Pygame Library

A space shooter created in Python using the Pygame Library, with a randomly generated starfield, animated sprites and sound effects.

At the moment only a single enemy spawns and of one type only - I plan to increase the amount displayed at one time as the difficulty increases, as well as
having a wider variety of enemies with different amounts of damage etc..

It's currently playable... although, you can't die!
