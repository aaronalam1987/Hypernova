# Hypernova
A space shooter created in Python using the Pygame Library, with a randomly generated starfield, animated sprites and sound effects.

Currently has a variety of enemies although their only goal is to drift towards the player, also a few upgrades at certain
score values and an collectable health bonus.

It's nothing fancy but it works - plenty to build off of.
